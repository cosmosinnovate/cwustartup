        Stylesheets and Preprocessors
        ==============================

        You can always bring in CSS files manually with `link` tags, or asynchronously
        on the client using a solution like AMD (RequireJS).  Or, if you like, you can
        take advantage of Sails' boilerplate asset management.

        By default, stylesheets from your `assets/linker/styles` folder are included
        here automatically.  Both CSS (.css) and LESS (.less) are supported.
        In production, your styles will be minified and concatenated into a single file.
        
        To customize any part of the built-in behavior, just edit your Gruntfile.
        For example, here are a few things you could do:
            
            + Change the order of your CSS files
            + Import stylesheets from other directories
            + Use a different or additional preprocessor, like SASS, SCSS or Stylus
